# Code-Quiz

## Introduction

This application allows the user to test their coding knowledge by asking them a series of code-related questions that they must answer correctly in under 75 seconds. Their final score is equal to how much time they have left on the timer once they've answered the last question correctly. The user may then save their score and return to the homepage to try again and beat their best time. If they wish to clear out their high score history and start over they may do so at any time.

Building this quiz taught me so much about creating an application from scratch. It taught me about the importance of pseudocoding and breaking down a project into smaller tasks. This way they can be completed and tested one at a time, making the project as a whole seem more accomplishable. It taught me how to use the DOM to manipulate my HTML file using JavaScript, and in doing so how to build single-page dynamic web applications. This project also taught me about working with timers and how to store information in local storage that can be accessed from your device at a later time.
